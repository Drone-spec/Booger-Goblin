# Booger-Goblin
Snort 3 Rule Generator

python3 ./rulemaker.py 

it looks for the two files and yanks IP's from IP file and Domains / websites from the domains file.

Improvements when I have time..

- CLAP for telling it files to use
- Sorting based on pattern matching (IP's xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
- Some kinda of additional use of content filtering.
